# Equity Net Theme

## Compiling Source
This theme uses gulp behind npm to compile SASS and JS.  To get started, run `npm install` then `npm start` to begin 
a development environment complete with livereload and sourcemaps. This task will watch for changes until you cancel it.
Alternatively, `npm run build` will build production-ready code.
